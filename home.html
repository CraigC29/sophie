  <h5 class="galleryInfo">Our hablab point B is a space that’s designed specifically around relaxed living. Point B is a temporary home for travellers and mountaineers. It’s made for travellers at the end of their journey, point B is where they travel too in the end for a tranquil space where they can clear their head to think.
we wanted to make this one of a kind so When we were brainstorming ideas the quote “thinking outside the box” didn’t really apply to our team, instead we done the opposite and created a box inside a box, we’ve used sliding doors and windows especially along with our additional addons to the base frame to achieve this.
When it came to colour for our HabLab I didn’t want to do anything too radical, especially because of how intricate our idea already was. I wanted to keep the colour as minimalistic as we could with only certain pops of colour in specific bits, the orange was chosen for this because of previous research, this colour came up a lot and we all seemed to take to it well, also the orange works as bringing some warmth too the room.
We wanted to specifically keep away from natural colours especially greens and browns this is because we wanted our Hablab to stand out in the environment it’s been placed in. </h5>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <h5>
      Our inspiration for our hablab came originally from our pecha kucha presentation. when looking through different design themes throughout the centuries we were very much drawn to the Bauhaus movement and minimalism movement. We were very drawn to the bauhaus movement due to its colours and shapes, we really took this into consideration when we were looking at the original design of the hablab, we wanted something that has multiple functions but wasn't overpowering with shapes and colour this is why the hablab only has 3 colours included, white, black and the subtle pop of orange for warmth within the room. The minimalism movement influenced our hablab greatly. Without looking into this modern movement our hablab would have looked completely different. Our hablab is centred around living in the middle of no where in a small box, within this box we needed for it to be suitable for a person to actually live in, which means it couldn't be cluttered with unnecessary extras, this is is where minimalistic living came into our design.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <h5>
      Honestly this was one of the most enjoyable modules throughout the year, even though I'm not the biggest fan of group work I really enjoyed working with the people I was grouped with. I enjoyed the freedom of being given a blank canvas and our imagination being able to take over and think of out of the box ideas. I liked being able to get into the workshop and create our own ideas. The part of the module I found most difficult was creating the website, the coding for my website had me up late most nights as deadline day came closer, I'm not the most confident on computers as it is and this task has made me now want to stay even further away from them, I'm glad in the end I've gotten it all finished, not to my exact way I wanted it but I'm glad I kept with coding my website over using Wordpress, it was a learning experience.
